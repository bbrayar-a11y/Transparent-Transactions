Now I will tell you what I understood (No need to code yet)

Technical:
	My computer holds the source code, I push them to git as and when modifications happen.
	I am the first user holding a hardcoded referral link
	Other users log in using referral link generated by me.
	They share their links for their users to join.
	Referral links are stored upto level 4. (I am default for missing levels)
	Data is stored locally, Your explainations about pros and cons is acceptable. 
	No need to code, till things finalise and I have successfully my local folder to git.
	git is already installed in my computer. 




Mutual Consent (The "Digital Shakehand"): This is the most critical part. If User A records a transaction with User B, how does User B confirm it?
This is what we need to develop. First on demo basis, then on production level. 
We need to use in app communications. 

Since we have no central server to send notifications, should we generate a unique, shareable link or QR code for the transaction? User A could send this to User B via WhatsApp. User B would then open the link, which would take them to a page in the app to confirm or deny. Does this workflow make sense?

Transaction Types:
Credit Transfer: How is this different from User A simply recording a new transaction of the opposite type (e.g., "I Got ₹500 from Ramesh")? 
Strict Condition: Ramesh must accept it. One is debited and another one credited. System Net=0, always.
Is it meant to explicitly link back to and close out a specific previous debt?

Digital Agreement: What does this entail? Is it for recurring transactions (e.g., monthly rent) or for creating a formal record of a future promise?
You are right. 

3-Way Authentication: What is the role of the third party? Are they a witness? A mediator? A concrete example would be very helpful here.
Well here, in case of credit transfer. A transfers his credit with B to his Credits with C. A is the initiator, B and C must agree. Ledgers change accordingly. Finally System Net=0, always.

Referral Chain Depth: Your SOP mentions a 4-level commission. When User D signs up with User C's code, we need to track the chain D -> C -> B -> A to pay commissions. Our current system only stores the immediate referrer. We should plan to store the full referral path for each new user.
We must do it. 
Published Trust Report: When a user pays to publish their report, what does the public see? Is it an anonymous page with just a score and a "verified" stamp? Or does it include the user's name?

Public only see the published reports (Paid ofcourse)





a) 	This is not a fund transfer App
b)	The app doesn't handle users money
c)	User's join using their friends referral link. (He can share his link for others to join)
d)	Users create contacts from their phone book.
e)	There are three types of transactions
	e1)	Transaction Creation
	e2)	Credit Transfer
	e3)	Digital Agreement
f)	All transactions get into ledger after 2way or 3way authentication.
g)	User's trust core is generated based upon their transactions with their own friends subject to red flag detection
h)	The apps revenue comes from generating trust report and publishing trust report.
