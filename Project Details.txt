| Report Generator's Level | Payout to Upline Level 1 | Payout to Upline Level 2 | Payout to Upline Level 3 | Payout to Upline Level 4 | Total Payout |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Level 1** (Frontline) | **INR 30** | - | - | - | INR 30 |
| **Level 2** | **INR 16** | **INR 14** | - | - | INR 30 |
| **Level 3** | **INR 16** | **INR 8** | **INR 6** | - | INR 30 |
| **Level 4+** | **INR 16** | **INR 8** | **INR 4** | **INR 2** | INR 30 |




I will put it in a simple way

The system starts with INR 30,
if all upliners are [null], entire 30 is mine
If upline0 is not null, 16%, if upline1 is null 14% is mine
If upline0 is not null, 16%, if upline1 is not null 8%, 6%  is mine
and so on. Okay?

The revenue comes from generating a trust report. 
If some one in my immediate downline generates a report, All 30% is mine,
If some one in my immediate downline's downline  generates a report, My immediate downline will get 16% I get 14%
Next it will be 16%+8%+4%+2%
From there onwards it becomes 16%+8%+4%+2%+0%+0%
Which means to say only the immediate upliners will earn the commission. Not even me


We must ensure that if [null] is encountered, the commission must come to me. Did we do it?

The Goal is
When First liner earns commission
Level 1	16%
My commission 14%

When Second liner earns commission
Level 2		16%
Level 1		8%
My commission 6%

When Third liner earns commission
Level 3		16%
Level 2		8%
Level  1	4%	
My commission 2%

When Fourth liner earns commission
Level 4		16%
Level 3		8%
Level  2	4%	
Level 1		2%
My commission 0%

Why cant we have

First level	Code-A	Code-A	Code-A	Code-A
Second level	Code-A	Code-A	Code-A	Code-B
Third level	Code-A	Code-A	Code-B	Code-C
Fourth level	Code-A	Code-B	Code-C	Code-D

So the work flow is 

1	User enters thru a referral link
2	Fills the details----> continue
3	Data Base Created
4	User is in the dashboard.
	Dashboard Shows
		Name, Phone Number, 
		Buttons to add contacts, Record Transactions, Reports(For Further Use)
Your Comments Please

What happens if a user tries to confirm a transaction that's already been confirmed?
Let us only concentrate on onboarding at this stage. 

Is there a way for users to track their referral network and rewards?
We must build this within existing framework (indexedDB) No centralised database.

How are disputes or cancellations handled in this transaction flow?
Let us only concentrate on onboarding at this stage. 

git add .
git commit -m "Implement onboarding and transaction confirmation flow"
git push origin main


So the onboarding process is:

User hits the referral link.
Enters his Phone Number, Gets otp, 
(Referral link is clubbed with the phone number entered in the local database)
Once authenticated, Gets to enter his name.
After Meeting all above conditions. Hits continue.
He is in the dashboard.
He has three working options, a) Add Contacts b) Invite his friends (Only those who are not existing users of the app) c) View the published reports. 
Other options are non functional. 

Your comments on it. 



My Comments: 
Step 1: Welcome & Identity
Page: onboarding-step1.html
Purpose: To make the user feel like this is their account.
Headline: "Welcome, [User's Name]!"
Core Action: A single, friendly input field: "What should we call you?" (Pre-filled with the default User 1234, but editable).
Button: "Continue"
Why this works: Personalization is the first step to engagement. It immediately invests the user in their profile.

Step 1 is fine. 

Step 2: Build Your Trust Network
Page: onboarding-step2.html
Purpose: To solve the "empty app" problem. The app is useless without contacts.
Headline: "Your trust is built with people you know."
Core Action: A large, primary button: "Add Your First Contact". This triggers the phone's native contact picker.
Safety Net: A smaller link below: "Or Enter a Number Manually". 
This opens a simple form with "Name" and "Phone Number" fields for desktop users or those who can't use the picker.
Why this works: It forces the user to perform the most critical first action. We explicitly tell them why they're doing it, connecting it to the core value of "trust."

Step 2 is fine.

Step 3: Understand the Core Loop
Page: onboarding-step3.html
Purpose: To set expectations and prime the user for the main action on the dashboard.
Headline: "You're all set! Here's how it works."
Core Content: A simple, visual 3-step graphic:
Record: "You record a transaction with a contact."
Share: "You send them a secure confirmation link."
Confirm: "They confirm, and it's added to your trusted ledger."
Final Button: A big, satisfying button: "Go to My Dashboard".
Why this works: It answers the "What now?" question and ensures the user understands the unique value proposition of the "Digital Shakehand" before they even see the main dashboard.

Step 3 is fine.

Technical Work Involved (Discussion Points)
Redirection Logic:
When a brand-new user signs up in auth.js, we will redirect them to onboarding-step1.html instead of index.html.
The checkLoginStatus() function (which protects the dashboard) will need a check: if the user is logged in but has not completed onboarding, they get redirected back to onboarding-step1.html.
State Management:
How do we know if onboarding is complete? We can add a simple flag to the user's object in IndexedDB: onboardingComplete: true.
This flag is set to true only after the user clicks "Go to My Dashboard" on the final step.
Data Persistence:
The name the user enters in Step 1 must be saved to the users store in IndexedDB.
The contact they add in Step 2 must be saved to the contacts store.

If an existing user hits the referral link, he will be directed to the dashboard, or to the onboarding process where he/she left during their last attempt. Old referral link is maintained.
